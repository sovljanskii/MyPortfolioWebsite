          I'm currently studying Software Engineering at the Faculty of
          Computing (Raƒçunarski fakultet) in Belgrade, Serbia.

          I started with programming very early; in middle school, making
          mini-applications and websites, and with every year, my algorithmic
          thinking escalated and my problem-solving skills too. Recognizing that
          I was inclined toward programming, I attended the Electro-engineering
          school majoring in information technology, where I acquired the basics
          of programming, database design, and web development and earned the
          title of Engineer of Information Technology.
        </p>
        <p className="text-p">
          I am a creative individual who enjoys solving problems and creating
          new stuff, always eager to learn new things and improve my skills.
